# LeNet model with MNIST recognition
LeNet (or LeNet-5) is a convolutional neural network structure proposed by Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner in 1989. The first purpose of this network is to recognize handwritten digits in images. It was successfully applied for identifying handwritten zip code numbers provided by the US Postal Service. 

In this project, we are going to discover the architecture of this network as well as its application in MNIST handwritten digit images.
